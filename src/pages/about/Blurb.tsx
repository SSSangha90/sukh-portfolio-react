      <p>
        I am a focused and driven Full Stack JavaScript Software Developer with
        5 years' commercial experience. Most recently I was a Senior UX

        I am largely a self-taught developer and undertook an intensive on-site
        full stack development bootcamp in 2018, covering HTML5, CSS3,
        JavaScript, C# and SQL. I have commercial experience working wth NoSQL
        databases such as DynamoDB and MongoDB. Furthermore I have worked with a
        range of third-party APIs such as Shopify and Social Media APIs.
