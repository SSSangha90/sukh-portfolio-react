    <About>
      <p>
        I am a focused and driven Full Stack JavaScript Software Developer with
        5 years' commercial experience. Most recently I was a Senior UX
        Developer at Push Live working with ReactJS, Styled Components,
        React-Storybook, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript and NodeJS on AWS Lambda.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am largely a self-taught developer and undertook an intensive on-site
        full stack development bootcamp in 2018, covering HTML5, CSS3,
        JavaScript, C# and SQL. I have commercial experience working wth NoSQL
        databases such as DynamoDB and MongoDB. I am adaptable at learning and
        using new technologies - I am currently buildng a side project using
        NextJS and Tailwind CSS for example.
