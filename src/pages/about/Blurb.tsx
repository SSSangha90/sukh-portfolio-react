    <About>
      <p>
        I am a focused and driven Full Stack JavaScript Software Developer with
        5 years' commercial experience. Most recently I was a Senior UX
        Developer at Push Live working with ReactJS, Styled Components,
        React-Storybook, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript and NodeJS on AWS Lambda.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for software development came about whilst working as
        recruitment consultant within the field. This sparked my interest and I
        began coding in my spare time. Thereafter, I undertook an on-site,
        self-funded development bootcamp, focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#
        and SQL.
